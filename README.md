# Molecular dynamics

Molecular dynamics simulations can solve numerically the dynamic of a particle system. Depending on the situation, these particles can be an ideal representation of atoms, molecules, grains of sand or even marbles. Of course, the methods used in molecular dynamics suppose that the microscopic dynamic is known. The computer resolution of movement equations is particularly interesting for systems which contain a lot of particles. It is a common situation in many domains, in particular statistical physics.

## Hard disk dynamics

The simulation is done in two dimensions. We consider N disks in a box. These particles are "hard": the collisions between them and with the walls are elastic.

The program must simulate such a system, with the possibility to graphically display the particles' positions.
