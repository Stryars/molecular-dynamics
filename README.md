# Molecular dynamics

A small exercise for a C/C++ module at ESPCI Paris. The goal is to simulate a system of N particles using event-driven programming. The simulation is done in two dimensions. We consider N disks in a box. These particles are "hard": the collisions between them and with the walls are elastic.
