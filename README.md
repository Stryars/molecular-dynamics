# Molecular dynamics ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Stryars/molecular-dynamics.svg?branch=master)

A small exercise for a C/C++ module at ESPCI Paris. The goal is to simulate a system of N particles using event-driven programming. The simulation is done in two dimensions. We consider N disks in a box. These particles are "hard": the collisions between them and with the walls are elastic.

Based on [_Algorithms, 4th Edition_](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/61event/).
